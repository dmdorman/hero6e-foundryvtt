# Features

Here is a list of 6e Hero System skills, perks, talents, powers, modifiers and complications. Where the 5e rules are similar, likely the support is the same as 6e. Where 5e differs dramatically, 5e will generally have poorer support than 6e.

Our support ratings:

- **A**: Full support and automation. Power descriptions largely match Hero Designer.
- **B**: Good support and automation. A few rare edge cases may be unsupported, those edge cases may have limited/no automation. Power descriptions largely match Hero Designer, but power costs may be incorrect.
- **C**: Poor support. Simplistic dice rolling.  Defenses/results are poorly/wrongly applied. Power description shows name, but some non-damage details may be missing/incorrect and power costs have not been reviewed.
- **D**: Minimal support. Dice rolling is not available, wrong, or otherwise poorly implemented. No automation. Power description shows name, but likely missing significant details and power costs have not been reviewed.
- **F**: Unknown or No support. HDC upload may not even work.
