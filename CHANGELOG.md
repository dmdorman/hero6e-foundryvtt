Note that the Default Edition (5e/6e) setting is used to create the compendiums. [#141](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/141) [#1101](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1101)

  - Can select token(s) across scenes.
- Video: [Hero System 6e (Unofficial) v2 - Mind Scan - Basic](https://youtu.be/eMoYvJQHVsg)

## Version 3.0.78

- Initial support for Mind Scan. [#1066](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1066)
  - Only works when Mind Scan actor & target are in the same scene.
  - If GM targets a visible token on behalf of the player, that token gets a target dot and may reveal unwanted information.
- Perception skill moved to top of skill tab. [#1069](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1069)
- Fixed issue where some attacks were charging twice for END. [#1075](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1075)

- Fix for AID and likely other adjustment powers. [#1058](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1058)
- [Video: Aid and Drain - Basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3I7SshLlyI)

## Version 3.0.75

- We recommend sticking with FoundryVTT v11.  Known v12 issues:
  - [Drag Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler) module breaks several things.
  - [Bar Brawl](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/barbrawl) mostly works. Oddities changing token images.
- FoundryVTT 12.327 support.
- Reworked Combat Tracker to more closely align to FoundryVTT v12.
- Improved chat messages for power toggles to include GM & token owners.
- Improved initial toggle states during HDC upload.  For example, items in a multipower default to off.
- Improved BASE actor type support. PD and ED are now resistant.  BODY now shows in characteristics tab. Implied DCV=3 or 0 if adjacent.
- [Barrier proof of concept](https://youtu.be/fINMDsyObK0).
- Fix for compound powers within a list, where not all compound items were uploaded.  Also fixed issue where some compound power items were duplicating modifiers. [#964](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/964)
- You can now make attack rolls from equipment tab.
- Added EXPERIENCE field to the OTHER tab.  Be careful as this gets overwritten when you upload an HDC file.

## Version 3.0.74

- We recommend sticking with FoundryVTT v11. The [Drag Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler) author [is working on v12 support](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler/issues/326#issuecomment-2148372052).
- Improvements to AVAD and NND attacks.
- Fixed damage dice for Nerve Strike and similar martial NND attacks. [#885](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/885)
- Support for multiple Combat Skill Levels associated with an attack.
- Combat Skill Levels purchased as powers can be toggled. [#995](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/995)
- Support for REQUIRESASKILLROLL and EVERYPHASE for defenses during Apply Damage. [#457](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/457)
- Improved Penalty Skill Level support. PSLs can have attack(s) specified and penalty type specified.  Only the range penalty is currently supported. [#863](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/863)

## Version 3.0.73

- Fix for PC actor sheets failing to open when actor has frameworks or compound equipment. [#1036](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1036)
- The alternate Savuori actor sheet logic now uses the default actor sheet. It still retains the simpler color scheme.

## Version 3.0.72

- FoundryVTT v12 limited support. We recommend sticking with v11 for now as some key modules do not support v12 yet. If you choose to proceed with v12 here is what we have tested:
  - You should disable the [Drag Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler) module as it currently breaks several things. You can CTRL+CLICK+DRAG a token to measure, then spacebar to move for now (default Foundry). [DR#319](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler/issues/319) [DR#324](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler/issues/324)
  - [Dice So Nice!](https://gitlab.com/riccisi/foundryvtt-dice-so-nice) seems to work just fine.
  - [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar) seems to work just fine.
  - [About Face](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/about-face) seems to work just fine.
  - [Bar Brawl](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/barbrawl) seems to work well.  Had to delete some of the bars on older tokens and recreate them, but it works. We plan to drop the built in 3rd bar support as Bar Brawl is superior.
  - [Elevation Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/elevationruler) is not currently recommended, but we are looking into Drag Ruler alternatives. It overrides our custom labels that show movement type and range penalties.  Dropped tokens don't always center in hex.
  - We have more testing to do, this list is not comprehensive. Feel free to submit [bug/issues](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues) if you find any v12 bugs that we haven't mentioned.
- Improved chat messages during combat for powers that use END each phase. Powers automatically turn off when there is insufficient END.  GM gets a message when any power is toggled.
- Fixed combat tracker issues with FoundtyVTT V12 where onStartTurn was only called postSegment12. This was preventing the consumption of END for continuous powers. [#1024](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1024)
- Movement radio buttons now display even when [Drag Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler) is not active.  Unselecting a token removes movement radio buttons to avoid confusion.
- Fixed various issues preventing the ability to toggle some powers.
- You can hold down the control key when toggling a power to force success of associated Requires A Roll.  Useful for GM's.
- Skills now support CHARGES and COSTEND modifiers. [#908](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/908)


## Version 3.0.71

- FoundryVTT v12 initial support. We recommend sticking with v11 for now as some key modules do not support v12 yet. If you choose to proceed with v12 there are some known issues:
  - You should disable the [Drag Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler) module as it currently breaks a few things. [DR#319](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler/issues/319) [DR#324](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler/issues/324)
  - Combat tracker is not consuming END for constant powers nor resetting movement history (but Drag Ruler is broken anyway).
  - We haven't tested much yet so this list is not comprehensive.
- Improved item drag & drop behavior. Dropped item descriptions are updated on drop, and any parenting associated with frameworks is removed.
- You can now toggle INVISIBILITY, it consumes END while in combat, and triggers the invisibility status condition if invisibility's primary option is SIGHT GROUP.  Enhanced senses are not implemented so the GM will have to address invisibility vs enhanced senses.
- Fix Combat Skill Levels attack enumerations. Attacks are now listed by name when provided, and by generic power when no name is provided. [#1004](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1004)
- Fixed issue where some compound powers subitems were showing in the wrong actor sheet tab or not showing at all.
- Skill Levels now default to unchecked, with some educated guessing by matching characteristic or Skill Levels options. [#1006](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1006)
- Improved CSL selection of attacks for compound powers. [#1007](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1007)
- Improved CP and AP on actor sheet header. Equipment is now summarized correctly. AP hover title shows breakout.
- Fix issue where STR shows END use in chat card but not actually consumed. [#1018](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/1018)
- Initial KNOCKBACK damage support.  The knockback text in the chatcard is now a button that automates the damage and associated defenses. [#810](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/810)
- Add custom AOE templates for 5e radius (v11 and v12) and cone (v12 only) AOE to match hex counted versions.  These are enabled by default on all hexagonal scenes and be disabled in the settings. [#997](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/997)
- Added new setting to specify 6e vs 5e rules for the world in the rare situation where an actor is not initiating the action.  Defaults to 6e, which is how it previously was.

## Version 3.0.70

- Reworked AOE templates to support the differences between 5e and 6e as we understand them.
- Under the hood preparation for FoundryVTT V12.

## Version 3.0.69

- Improved AOE template accuracy. [#966](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/966)
- Removed auto success/miss for standard AOE targets. [#965](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/965)
- Initial support for STR MINIMUM. STR damage is reduced by STR MINIMUM, but no OCV/DC penalties for low STR. [#971](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/971) [#127](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/127)
- Initial support for WEAPON_MASTER talent. [#972](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/972)
- Initial support for DEADLYBLOW talent. [#972](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/972)
- Initial support for PERSONALIMMUNITY. [#973](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/973)
- Reworked Combat Skill Levels. They now use Custom Adders to store attack details.  You can use Custom Adder in your HD file to streamline future imports, so you don't have to update your CSLs every time you import. Educated guessing of which attacks apply if you don't provide them in the HD file as custom adders. [#883](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/883)

## Version 3.0.68

- Correct range penalty calculations. [#944](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/944)
- 5e actors will now see ruler measurements in hexes ("). We still recommend both 5e and 6e scenes use a grid size of 2m.
- Additional in-game editing support focused mainly on AOE.

## Version 3.0.67.1

- Improve descriptions for senses. [#934](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/934)
- Correct default 6e AOE line width and height determination. [#937](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/937)

- Presence attack can now do 1/2 dice and 1/2 dice modification increments. [#943](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/943)
- Attacks now have auto success (3) and auto failure (18). [#562](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/562) [#522](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/522)
- Warning is now given when attacking with no target selected. [#927](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/927)
- Improved SHRINKING and GROWTH support. [#936](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/936)
- Fix for POWERSKILL where it was not rollable.

## Version 3.0.66

- Fix velocity calculations for 5e. [#923](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/923)
- Calculated velocity for maneuvers can now be adjusted in the to hit dialog when necessary. [#923](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/923)
- Improved in-game editing:
  - You can add most skills, powers, etc to an actor in-game. Frameworks, compound powers, and enhancers can not be added in-game yet.
  - Some editing options are confusing and will be improved in future releases.
  - A limited number of adders and modifiers can be added to items.  Will add more in future releases.
  - Simplified editing of attacks.  Using adders for +1/2 d6 and +1 pip.
  - There is minimal vetting of in-game editing.  Any invalid adders/modifiers for a specific power will likely to be ignored and/or may cause automation issues.
  - Items modified in-game may have incorrect costs and active points.
  - Be careful when re-uploading HDC files as in-game edits for that actor will be overwritten without warning.

## Version 3.0.65

- Fix crash during HDC upload with change environment and the damage adder.
- Improve martial maneuvers using `[FLASHDC]` and `[STRDC]` effects. [#850](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/850)
- Add phase information to martial maneuvers.
- Can now make attack rolls directly from the `MartialArts` tab. [#834](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/834)
- For odd time you don't want to count the result of a manual dice roll, `/heroroll` in chat is now a command. See [README.md](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/blob/main/README.md#manual-rolling) for details.
- Correct Find Weakness' and Danger Sense description and cost.
- Add success roll icon to the appropriate entries in the actor's sheet powers tab.
- Minimum damage calculation changed such that it is last in the damage application chain to allow penetrating killing attacks to do STUN >= BODY.
- Fix adjustment powers not getting power defense and add effects, such as penetrating, to adjustment chat card.
- Drag Ruler will now show proper 5e colours at appropriate distances.
- Defense are now properly applied to ADJUSTMENT POWERS. Added effect descriptions (such as penetrating) to adjustment chat card.
- You can now add most skills and some powers in game.  We're still adding the rest of the powers, perks, etc.  Only a few items (blast for example) are functionally editable at the moment.  One small step toward Hero Designer lite.

## Version 3.0.64

- Actors that were uploaded prior to 3.0.35 (October 2023) are no longer supported. You will need to re-upload these HDC files. You will see a limited number of warnings during migration. Advanced users can view all warnings in the browser developer console. [#856](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/856)
- Removed ability to create manual attacks, skills, powers, etc. Any manually created items breaks some of the new codebase. [#856](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/856)
- Actors with existing manual attacks, skills, powers, etc will show warnings during migration and when the actor sheet is opened. You can either delete the offending manual items, or (better yet) re-upload from HDC. We realize that there are missing features in the current system, however we believe you can create equivalent HDC powers to represent any need for a manually created attack. For example KNOCKBACK (missing feature) can be simulated with a HAND ATTACK with NO STR and NO END modifiers. Please reach out on Discord or GitHub if you are unable to create an attack to get around any missing features. [#856](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/856)
- Initial support for WELL_CONNECTED perk enhancer.
- Removed unnecessary dice showing with **Dice So Nice!** during attack rolls for stun multiplier, hit location, and hit location side. [#793](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/793)
- **Hit location** and **hit location side** dice roll results can now been seen in the dice roll tooltip.
- Can now aim for a location and side (e.g. left arm) when hit location and individual body part damage tracking are enabled.
- Killing attack STUN should now be correct when using hit locations. [#824](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/824)
- Improve penetrating BODY and STUN calculations for killing attacks and adjustments. [#851](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/851)
- Support for Heroic Action Points. Enable in settings. Shown on actor sheet left sidebar. [#844](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/844)
- We have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcmq0WFFNZNhRSGwuEHOgRg) with an introductory how to video.

## Version 3.0.63

- Potentially long running activities (HDC upload and migration) now sport a progress bar.
- Removed range penalties for LINE OF SIGHT, NO RANGE MODIFIER, and LIMITED NORMAL RANGE (NORMAL RANGE). [#789](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/789)

## Version 3.0.62

- Add all 5e/6e maneuvers and optional maneuvers to actors. Optional maneuvers will only show on actor sheet when "optional maneuvers" configuration option selected. Maneuvers still, however, may not work correctly.
- Improved COMPOUNDPOWER to support characteristics & skills. [#711](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/711)
- PS/KS/SS descriptions, rolls, and costs improved.

## Version 3.0.61

- Actor shows systemVersion at time of HDC upload on actor sheet. [#800](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/800)
- Fixed issue where legacy actors with missing item details prevented actor sheet from opening.
- Perception can now be rolled again from the skills tab. [#806](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/806)

## Version 3.0.60

- Fixes for TELEKINESIS (TK punch/strike).
- Effective STR specified as part of the attack is no longer ignored.  Allows for attacks at less than full power, thus conserving END.
- Fixes for ENDURANCERESERVE. [#783](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/783)
- 5e now shows proper lift capacities for STR values under 5. [#709](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/709)
- Skill levels now apply when rolling skills. Skill rolls can now auto succeed or fail.

- Autofire attacks now use endurance for each shot.
- Fixed player combat tracker crash when there are non-visible tokens in the combat tracker. [#650](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/628) [#654](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/650)
- Improve stun/body/effect only and 5e explosion attack tags. [#630](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/630) [#666](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/666)

  - The first character to act in combat won't get dinged for active endurance using powers twice.
  - Correct endurance deduction for characters that have powers active that use endurance without power modifiers.
- Improvements to adjustment powers (although we suggest still only using them for characteristics):
  - Adjustment powers should now respect uploaded multi sources and targets when triggering. They should also respect maximum effects for absorption, aid, and transfer.
  - No adjustment powers should be killing attacks that are enhanced by strength.
  - Correct resistant power defense.
  - Calculated power defense will now be shown on the character sheet.

- Configuration setting to toggle custom resource bars.  Existing worlds will retain custom resource bars, new worlds will default to core FoundryVTT resource bars.  The [Bar Brawl](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/barbrawl) module is superior, although requires some configuration.  Bugs related to system custom bars still exist.  We are likely to deprecate the custom resource bars in this system. [#502](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/502) [#368](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/368) [#274](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/274) [#174](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/174)

- Fix when "Equipment Weight Percentage" is changed in game settings and there are tokens with no associated actor.
- When powers are sent to chat the range of the power is included in the chat message. [#323](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/323)

## Version 3.0.33

- Target DCV and "hit by" are now hidden from players. GM's will see a white-ish background and blue outline for items hidden from players in chat messages. [#351](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/351)
- The "Roll Damage" button is now only shown for token owners.

## Version 3.0.32

- Initial REDUCEDPENETRATION support.  Rules as written are to split the attack into two separate dice pools, which is awkward with the current system.  A simplified solution is to apply defenses twice to the body damage. [#313](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/313)
- Initial Actor description.  Sends APPEARANCE and all obvious & inobvious powers to chat log.  A future improvement will include a perception roll for inobvious powers. [#311](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/311)
- Improved migration script.  Fixes mistakes in some power costs & power descriptions without the need to re-upload HDC.

## Version 3.0.29

- Reworked Characteristics internal data structure.  Consolidating 6e/5e base, core, costs, bought as powers, etc into one data structure.  Improved hover descriptions.  You can now make changes to CORE characteristics, which will update BASE and COST.  Core, base, and cost are mostly for reference and have no effective gameplay function; although MAX should equal CORE  when all powers/effects are turned off.  This is a small step toward improving actor editing within FoundryVTT.
- Fixed incorrect values for some 5e movements during HDC upload. [#299](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/299)

## Version 3.0.28

## Version 3.0.23

- Improved AOE EXPLOSION support. Damage is now based on distance from template. [#151](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/151)
- Area Effect Cone is now 60º and narrow cone 30º support [#276](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/276)

- Clicking on a locked characteristic will prompt to unlock [#261](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/261)
- Improved AOE workflow. Attacker is prompted to place an AOE template, which automatically selects visible targets within the template.  AOE attacks assume template always hits hex and that all targets are hit regardless of their DCV.

## Version 3.0.18

- Fix for new attacks that only worked with alpha flag turned on.

## Version 3.0.17

- Improved CSL detection of small/large group by selecting the first 3 attacks for small group, and all attacks on the attack tab for large group.  You can edit CSL's after upload to override auto selection of relevant attacks.
- Martial +1 HTH Damage Class(es) was incorrectly created as an attack and shown in attack tab. [#258](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/258)
- Fixed missing martial "+1 Ranged Damage Class(es)" upload.
- Templates automatically select tokens within the template.  Intend to improve AOE attack workflow.
- Initial AVAD support. [#206](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/206)

- Migration unnecessary on new/empty worlds [#254](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/254)
- Initial support for vehicles, bases, computers, automatons, and ai's. [#109](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/109)
- Fixed issue with some talents failing to upload, that would prevent other powers from uploading.  Improved warn/error messages during upload to assist with similar issues in the future.
- Improved defense summary tooltips/mouseovers.

## Version 3.0.15

- Fixes for Requires A Roll.  Attacks spend END when RAR fails.  Hotbar macros no longer RAR when powers toggle off. [#244](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/244)
- Initial Abort support.  Aborted status icon.  When Stunned, Knocked Out, or Aborted you can not act (make rolls or toggle powers on).
- Initial Block support.  Minimal automation here.  The GM/Player should speak up before the attacker rolls.  Multiple blocks are possible, but you have to remove the abort condition before making a second block at -2.  In the future it may be possible to prompt the defender if they want to block, and handle multiple blocks.  Block assume no STR/END use.  Any potential Initiative benefits to dodge are not automated.
- Initial Dodge support. [#105](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/105)
- Fixed Martial Arts uploads where OCV and DCV modifiers were ignored.
- Improved Blind and Prone statuses to include appropriate CV penalties. 
- Fixed 1/2 DCV rounding down.  Now follows standard rounding rules that favor the player. [#153](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/153)
- Initial AUTOFIRE support.  Some automation for single targets.  No automation for multiple targets as the workflow of tohit/damage would be awkward unless fully automated.  Full automation limits  the ability for GM's to handle unusual situations. [#43](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/43)
- Initial support for Skill Levels.  Player is prompted to confirm Skill Level applies to rolled skill.  Skill rolls now show tag details. [#89](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/89)
- Fixed issue where some active effects using icons not associated with statuses caused error when loading world.
- Initial Encumbrance penalty support. [#118](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/118)
- Fixed issue where END was spent twice a phase for actors with Lightning Reflexes.  Now it only spends END on the beginning of the non LR phase for that actor.
- Improved scrolling numbers for STUN and BODY changes.  They now show when you Take a recovery.  Also show for all players, not jus the GM.
- Improved Skill and Power descriptions. [#248](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/248)
- Improved Skill Enhancer calculations [#249](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/249)
- Fixed rare and minor issue where velocity wasn't calculated when there is no token for an actor. [#250](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/250)
- Fixed 0d6 + 1 rolls.  [#252](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/252)

## Version 3.0.14

- Fixed issue where some 5e powers were incorrectly calculating END.
- Support for Activation Rolls (similar to Requires a Roll)
- Initial support for conditional Defenses (Only Works Against & Conditional Power). GM will be prompted to select conditional defense when applying damage.  [#181](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/181)
- Improved Endurance/Stun (all) and Body (PCs only) recovery out of combat.  NPCs stop stun recovery once they are below -10 stun. PC stun recovery below -10 is still every phase, but should be using the Recovery Time Table (future improvement). Expected to use Simple Calendar to advance time out of combat.
- Active Effects split out into Temporary, Constant, or Persistent. Where Constant and Persistent largely match the HERO power description; and are typically always on (such as most defenses).  Temporary is for effects with a limited duration (such as AID).  In a future release constant powers will toggle off when knocked out.  May require HDC upload on existing actors for proper assignment. [#235](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/235)
- Defenses show as effects in other tab. Internally they are not Active Effects, but behave similarly.  A quality of life enhancement which shows all powers & effects in one spot.
- Combat Skill Levels (CSL) can be changed within the _Roll to Hit_ dialog. [#189](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/189)
- Initial support for DCV buffs/penalties associated with some attacks, that last until actors next phase. [#103](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/103)
- STUN and BODY changes for tokens show as scrolling combat text.  Stun is green and Body is red, matching the attribute bar colors. [#81](https://github.com/dmdorman/hero6e-foundryvtt/issues/81)

## Version 3.0.13

- Fixed Maneuver OCV/DCV.
- Velocity estimate uses full move.
